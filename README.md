1.	Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
a.	95% confidence has been predetermined, which means the p-value shouldnâ€™t be lower than .05 level of significance in order to verify its statistically significant.

2.	Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
a.	When looking at the scientific notation we see that all slopes of the variables are non-zero

3.	Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
a.	Yes this would be validate that the prototypes are effective as the P-Vale is 5.35
